									The image on my home page is a modified version of the MacRae clan crest. Above is a photo of the MacRae clan castle, Eilan Donan. It was featured in the 
									film Highlanders, as well as Skyfall. I visited it when I was seven and I remember feeling great knowing that technically, this was sort of <em>my</em> castle.</br>

									I was born in D.C. and raised in Singapore and Berlin until my family moved outside of Seattle. After high school, I attended University of Puget Sound
									and dove headfirst into reading and writing when I stumbled into coding with an introductory Java course. Although it caught my interest, I was already
									well on my way to an English degree, so I finished up my degree and was starting a career in journalism when I had a serious shoulder injury. I was forced
									to move to Florida to recover. One day I found my old Java textbook and began going through it. I came to love it so much that I decided to start fresh with 
									coding, and now here I am. I enjoy coding, hiking, and reading in my free time. Thanks for taking the time to check out my website!
