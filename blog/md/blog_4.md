# Exploring ASIC Miner Services (Crypto Ramble)

## Intro

I once knew a woman who used that phrase practically every second. It drove me crazy. 
In any case, the theory on the Pareto principle was nice but it crumbled when I tried
to put it to use yesterday. Time management is not my forte (note to self - look up how
to insert special characters in Vim). 

Today I want to ramble a little bit about my foray in to cryptocurrency. HODLers and whales
can mock me all they wish - actually, I don't hide my ignorance. I think that's part of the 
philosophy (and the fun) of this blog. You get to learn alongside me. Hopefully you'll see 
that learning occur in the form of some background colors, a sidebar with posts like what
you'd see on WordPress, and all that.

## I Missed Out

So, crypto. I was up until 1:30 AM (possibly later) last night reading about mining and trying to
actually learn about the tech behind crypto for the first time. I finally bought in during the
"dip" in June '21, so now I'm at least invested (Sorry Buffet/Graham, but "speculated" doesn't 
really roll of the tongue).

Every time I start looking into crypto, I get PFOMO - Post Fear Of Missing Out. I remember the first 
time I ever heard about Bitcoin. I was at a friend's house and his older brother's friend was going
to school for IT stuff. He showed us how many Bitcoin he owned (this had to have been around 2011/12)
and how he could use it to buy stuff on Silk Road. On an unrelated note, I remember this being around
the time that whole Domino's glitch with cinnamon sticks was happening, too. This happened so long ago
that I quite literally cannot find it with a cursory Google search. It was a 4chan thing anyways, I think.

Real quick, the deal with the Cinnastix was that for whatever reason, a coupon allowed you to add as many
free Cinnastix to your order as you wanted. So people were using it to literally order DOZENS of Cinnastix.
This was back in 2010. Man, how the internet has changed. 

## Compass Mining and ASIC Miner Hosting

So back to crypto/FOMO. Whenever I start looking into it, I get pissed that I could have swung several times
and didn't. So where does my mind go? To the most extreme places - mining operations! grassroots mining pools! 
a university sanctioned mining club (that'd be kind of cool, honestly). Apparently there was one at FSU but looks
like it's dead now. 

My regret-driven brainstorms lead me to a company called [Compass](https://compassmining.io/). They seem to act as a 
middle-man between ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) vendors and miner hosting facilities. So their business
plan is this: 

* sell you an ASIC miner (anywhere from $4-5k+)
* get you to sign a contract for a year of hosting services (depending on electricty, anywhere from $150+/mo)
* once the year is up, allow you to renew your contract or sell your (now used) ASIC miner on your behalf.

It's a pretty neat idea, honestly. Unfortunately, it's so neat that it looks too good to be true. The best my due diligence
has been able to scrape up are a couple of posts on Reddit claiming that Compass is indeed legit. But that's simply not
enough for me (or any reasonable person, really) to go off of. From what I can tell, the crypto world is rife with
scammers. So I'll stick to buying the currency outright on an exchange. That being said, I'd like to explain how I determined
that even if I did go through with this (which if I ever do, I will write about - somebody has to be a guinea pig), 
the profits would have been marginally better than just buying Bitcoin outright, considering the risk.


## Is Mining BTC via a Hosting Service Worth It?

I'm not going to do this justice, and if I'm misconstruing something, please email me at [c o m a c r a e 1 9 9 5]@gmail.com (get rid of spaces).

The act of *mining* bitcoin refers to the use of time/energy/computational resources to engage in **proof of work**, or the solving of an arbitrary
math problem which leads to extension/validation of the bitcoin blockchain. Most importantly, the bitcoin "mined" is rewarded to the *first* person 
who solves the problem. It is NOT SPLIT in any way (unless you pool, which I will get to). So basically, if you were to go and buy a used ASIC (or even
a new one, it seems), you would be absolutely destroyed by the massive warehouses of ASIC miners and distributed mining pools ( groups which have collected
their mining power and agree to split the won bitcoin). But I got carried away. 

You wanna mine? You gotta worry about a few things:

1. Buying a(n) ASIC miner(s)

Buying miners from vendors is near impossible right now because of chip shortages, and the second-hand market is scammy.

2. Cost of electricity (in $/kWh)

Number 2 is enough for most people to give up on mining. Residential electricity is often so expensive as to render mining unprofitable. 

3. Where to put the miner

But even if you had decent electricity costs (my city's utilities website says electricity is around $0.075/kWh which is pretty damn good),
you're basically signing up to keep an extremely noisy space heater in your home on 24/7. I live in a 500 sq ft 1br/1b apartment. Not gonna happen.

4. Setting up/maintaining the miner

Which leads me to the last point. Every second your miner isn't running is a second you're losing on your ROI (return on investment). This is true
for several reasons:

* more people entering mining space every day, reducing mining profits
* mining becomes more computationally difficult every year
* I'm sure there are others but I'm not smart enough to consider them

This is where Compass comes in (assuming it's legit). They charge a monthly fee in return for the following:

* you get to buy the ASIC miner through them (no worrying about getting scammed)
* they host it at a facility designed for storing miners
* they have on-site technicians who can fix any issues with your miner
* they have facilities in places which can obtain electricity much cheaper 

## The Calculations

So let's assume for a moment that a profitability calculator like [this one](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/calculator/) is accurate.

Then an ANTMINER SJ19 PRO with a hashrate of 110 TH/s and power consumption of 3500 W would mine 0.1455 BTC a year at a Compass facility where electricity was $0.065/kWh (assuming it ran FLAWLESSLY, 24/7).

Compass sells that miner for $7500 and they require 12 month contracts with a month down, quoting roughly at $160/month.

$7500 + ($160 x 12) = 9420. Let's make that $10000 just to make it an easier number. 

So, you could pay $10000 to have .1455 bitcoin a year from now. The same amount of money TODAY would buy you $10000 / $38522.37 = .2596 BTC 

My alarm went off so I gotta go. If I'm missing something, let me know, because it looks like at that cost, it makes way more sense to buy
BTC now than try and mine it using a hosting facility.
